# Crier

CrierJS is a non-convoluded publish-subscription system for JavaScript and NodeJS. Subscribers hook into a channel and wait for any sort of data to get thrown onto it; publishers throw data onto channels that subscribers are (maybe) watching. With this model, the publishers and subscribers aren't friends, relatives, or even acquaintancesâ€”in fact, they don't even know that the other exists (promoting loose coupling and scalability). There are no dependencies and it works (tested) in Node, all popular browsers, and IE8.

# Synopsis

``` javascript
Crier.sub('channel-1', function (ch, a, b) {
  console.log('channel ' + ch + ' got data ', a, b);
});

Crier.pub('channel-1', 2015, 'foo');
// "channel channel-1 got data 2015 foo"
```
